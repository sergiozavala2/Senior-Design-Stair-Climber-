This was for our senior design project. There was a total of 4 people working on this project. We tested our robot in the stairs and hallway of our engineering building in Sacramento State. The robot goes up and down the stairs. The purpose is to deliver food, papers, or any other items to students, staff, and faculty in the engineering building.
